# Moviestand
#### A gorgeous, multi-platform movie collection manager.

Releases for Windows, Linux and OS X will be available soon. In the meantime, if you want to try Moviestand you'll need Node.js installed.

To get a copy of the app simply run these commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jsayol/moviestand.git
    $ cd moviestand
    $ npm start

This will get the last version and run it.
